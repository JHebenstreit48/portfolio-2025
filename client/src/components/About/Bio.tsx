            <p className='bio'>
                I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a rich background in photography and music, complemented by a deep-seated passion for automotive technology and gaming. In November 2024, I completed a comprehensive 6-month Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp through Washington University in St. Louis, offered in partnership with edX. This intensive program honed my skills in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and React.

                In 2019, I earned Cisco's CCNA Security (210-260) and CCNA Collaboration (210-060) certifications. Although these certifications expired in 2022 following Cisco's certification restructuring in 2020, I am actively refreshing my knowledge in these areas with the goal of recertification, ensuring my networking skills remain current and robust.
