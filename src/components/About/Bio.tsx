                    I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a rich background in photography and music, complemented by a deep-seated passion for automotive technology and gaming. In November 2024, I completed a comprehensive 6-month Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp through Washington University in St. Louis, offered in partnership with edX. This intensive program honed my skills in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and React.
